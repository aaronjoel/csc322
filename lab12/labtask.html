<P>
Since we talked about pointers, memory allocation and linked lists in
class, I'd like you to write a program that allows the user
to: 
<UL>
<LI> Enter the names of persons.
<LI> For each person entered, enter the name of his/her best buddy.
<LI> Print out the "best buddys"
</UL>

Here what a sample run should look like (with the user input shown 
in italics) ...
<PRE>
Enter nation name : <EM>Tom</EM>
Enter nation name : <EM>Betty</EM> 
Enter nation name : <EM>Martin</EM>
Enter nation name : <EM>Michael</EM>
Enter nation name : <EM>Amanda</EM>
Enter nation name : <EM>Catharine</EM>
Enter nation name : 
Enter best ally name for Catharine : <EM>Amanda</EM>
Enter best ally name for Amanda : <EM>Michael</EM>
Enter best ally name for Michael : <EM>Martin</EM>
Enter best ally name for Martin : <EM>Betty</EM>
Enter best ally name for Betty : <EM>Amanda</EM>
Enter best ally name for Tom : <EM>Catharine</EM> 
The best ally of Catharine is Amanda
The best ally of Amanda is Michael
The best ally of Michael is Martin
The best ally of Martin is Betty
The best ally of Betty is Amanda
The best ally of Tom is Catharine </PRE>

<H3>You must ...</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Implement the program in C. (5.0%)
     <UL>
     <LI> Each person's name entered must be stored in a node of a linked list.
     <LI> Each node of the linked list must contain (only) the persons name, 
          a pointer to the node for its best buddy, and a pointer to the next 
          node in the list.
     <LI> Before the program completes it must explicitly <TT>free</TT> the
          <TT>malloc</TT>ed memory.
     </UL>
</UL>
