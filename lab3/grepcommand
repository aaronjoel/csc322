# grabs the lines that do not start with "//" (comments)
# and pipes these to the next grep
# which grabs lines that have "int" followed by at least one space
# then, it matches the pattern
	# starts with a-zA-Z$_ (all the valid first letters of Java ints)
	# followed by 0 or more matches of characters in a-zA-Z0-9_$
	# followed by spaces and possibly a comma, followed by more spaces
# and repeats it at least once
# ends with a semicolon
# and pipes everything to wc -l, which counts lines
