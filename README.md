Please, if you find this, don't blindly copy it. Thinking out a problem will make you a better coder. Look at these solutions only if you really can't figure out the answer. Even then, you should really try and digest the answer, to the point that you fully understand it.

If you're still stuck, and have made a decent attempt, ask your question on stackoverflow. Please, for the love of god, though, read the [help center](http://stackoverflow.com/help) on how to ask a *good* question *first*. That means including a small, self-contained example that demonstrates the problem at hand; in addition, you should clearly and concisely explain what isn't working, what you have attempted, and what you hope to accomplish. Otherwise, you will be downvoted.
