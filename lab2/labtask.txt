   Use a terminal session to:
    1. Create a file called ICanDoIt containing commands to do the following (not a script, just a file for the TA to grade):
          + A command to create a file called Help! I've run out of $s (0.1%).
          + An command that lists all the files (in the current directory) that start with an alphabetic character, contain a digit, and end with a dot
            followed by a lowercase character then one more character (0.4%).
          + A pipeline command from head to tail to grep, that will extract lines containing Computer Science course codes as distinct words from the 5th
            to 12th lines of this file. The "CSC" must start with an uppercase "C" but the "SC" may be written in any combination of uppercase and
            lowercase. A correct solution extracts lines numbered 5, 7, 10, and 12. (0.5%)
    2. Making files and directories
          + Make a directory called LabTask2 off your home directory (0.05%).
          + Off LabTask2, a subdirectory called Originals (0.05%).
          + In Originals two files, HardStuff and SoftStuff (put any garbage in them) (0.05%).
          + Off LabTask2, a subdirectory called Links (0.05%).
          + In Links
               o A hard link named LinkToHardStuff that links to HardStuff in Originals (0.15%).
               o A relative soft (symbolic link) link named RelativeToSoftStuff to SoftStuff in Originals(0.15%).
       Put the commands that you used to do these (including making the directories and files) into a file named MakingLinks.
    3. Find the following files and directories:
          + The file where your email addressed to your class account would be stored (if Irina let you receive email in your class account) (0.15%).
          + The file that contains the configuration for printers available to the computer (0.2%).
          + The directory that contains libraries for security using the Pluggable Authentication Module (0.2%).
       Put the full path names in a file called Eureka.
    4. Create a directory called IveGotRights off LabTask2. Set its permissions to:
          + Read, write, and execute permission for the owner (0.15%)
          + Read and execute permission for the group (0.15%)
          + Execute permission for others (0.15%)
       Put the commands that you used to do these into a file named Permissions.
