-0.2 your program gives the wrong output because it truncates integers (while calling a function)
-0.1 did not use a constant for depth-pressure conversion factor
-0.1 did not use defined constants for maximum and contingency pressure
instead of using 65, just use 'A'

please use descriptive variable names in the kangaroo program
